Introduction
============

CS244B Mazewar is a distributed, multiplayer game that allows each
player to control a rat in a maze. A player received points for tagging
other rats with a projectile and loses points for being tagged.

The game is based on the X Window System version of Mazewar, which is in
turn based on the classic game of Mazewar that ran on the Xerox Alto in
the 1970s. It is also based on Amaze, a multi-player game with a
distributed implementation on top of the V kernel.
